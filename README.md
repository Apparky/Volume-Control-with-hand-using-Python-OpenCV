# Volume-Control-with-hand-using-Python-OpenCV

> OpenCV is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. 
> OpenCV has a modular structure, which means that the package includes several shared or static libraries.
> 
> We have used a HandTracking module that tracks all points on the hand and detects hand landmarks, 
> calculate the distance between thumb tip and index fingertip and maps the distance between thumb tip and index fingertip with volume range.
> 
> To Creating a hand gesture volume controller the given library you'll need.
